just a test
does it detect changes?

I used:
  git pull origin master
and got your changes. 

Now to see if I can push them. 


So the key here was using "git pull" instead of "git fetch".  When I did that, I got your changes in this file.  I need to figure out what the difference is…

I'll put these up there now...
